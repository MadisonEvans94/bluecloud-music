for featuredRelease, I plan on having the PK and SK be the id. There will only ever be one featuredRelease displayed on my site at a time, so I don't really need to think to heavily about how its stored, as long as its accessible. For blog, I actually plan on structuring it out like this:

```js
{
	id: "BLOG#0001";
	title: "How I've been Producing Music Lately";
	year: "2023";
	month: "01";
	day: "24";
	shortDescription: "This blog talks about my music making process";
	content: [
		{
			type: "paragraph",
			info: "Lately I've been producing a lot of music",
		},
		{
			type: "image",
			info: "https://example_image.com/004",
		},
		{
			type: "paragraph",
			info: "Above is a picture of me making music",
		},
	];
}

const example = [12, 4, "4"];
```

    . This way I can have the year be the partition key and the concatenation of month and day be the sort key; this should allow me to paginate really efficiently, delivering the 10 most recent blogs at a time. And lastly, for the storeItems, I plan on using type as the PK, and id as the SK. This way, if I have 3 different types, and I want to render 3 different lists of components corresponding to these types, I can perform 3 concurrent fetch requests that each only have to do a query operation on their respective partitions. Do you understand my approach? If so, how is my logic? Is this a good idea for a set up? Do you have any suggestions?
