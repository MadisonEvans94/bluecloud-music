# Blue Cloud Music

"Blue Cloud Music" is a personal music website created using React and Flask. As an artist, producer, and audio engineer with over a decade of experience, this project showcases my music and creative abilities. The site features captivating animations, UI, and other design principles that I poured my heart into during the development process. Through this site, I am able to connect with my fans and share my music with the world. In addition, I plan to sell sample packs and plugins that I'm currently working on. "Blue Cloud Music" is a creative venture that allows me to express myself musically and share my passion with others.
